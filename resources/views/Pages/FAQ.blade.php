	<p class="default-text">Recreational Leagues is a FREE directory of various sport leagues. We act as another way for people to find your league. When you click on a league, you will see an information page and a brief description. If the league has a website, a link is provided.</p>

	<p class="default-text" style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 40px">Do you provide links to team websites?</p>

	<p class="default-text">Generally this question comes from teams in leagues that do not have their own website while your team does have a website. Our primary purpose is to provide links to leagues. At this time we do not provide links to individual teams.</p>
